# Food-dating
### ðŸ¥ˆ Awarded 2nd place on BITEhack 2022 hackathon ðŸ¥ˆ

Hate the feeling of finding old, expired food in your fridge
that you would have eaten happily only if you had known that 
it's going to expire soon? We're trying to solve this problem!

I'ts a proof of concept of an app to track expiry dates of products in your fridge,
developed in 24 hours on BITEhack 2022.
You just make photos of items in your fridge and enter their expiry dates.

"But hey! Aren't there plenty of such apps on the market?" - I hear you ask.\
And yes, there are lots of them, but none of them are simple, convenient nor quick. 

Our main goal is to make adding the food items as quick as possible because no one 
wants to spend extra time labeling products in their fridge.
